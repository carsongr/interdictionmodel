# What is an interdiction model? 
At a basic level, a network interdiction model aims to represent a system where one agent, the defender, seeks to optimize some objective by operating the network while another agent, the attacker, seeks to optimize the same objective in the opposite direction by 'interdicting', or disrupting, networ components. This framework allows us to model a 'worst-case' disruption to the network. Interdiction modeling has applications in power grid optimization, understanding drug trafficking networks, supply chain optimization, and generally any network problem where you might want to understand how resilient the network is to a worst-case disruption. 

It's worth noting that the interdicting agent does not necessarily need to be a human attacker. It can also represent things such as natural disasters, component outages, etc. The main idea is that the interdictor will disrupt the network  such that it most effectively impedes the operator from optimizing their objective, hence the reason interdiction models a 'worst-case' disruption.
